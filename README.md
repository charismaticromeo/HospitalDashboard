# HospitalERDashboard
This project is a design of a sample hospital emergency room dashboard that would help a healthcare provider have a quick status of the hospital and also help the management lay a proper plan for effectively running their hospital to ensure efficiency, proper assignment of resources and maximum patient satisfaction.

## Disclaimer
The data used in this project isn't of any real hospital because of confidentiality concerns but an RWFD (Real World Fake Data) from https://data.world a great source for data.
